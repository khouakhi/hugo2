Hugo web page modification: 

to modify a file (e.g add updated cv) 
- copy the new cv in public/file (in the name of the file is nor the same, change it in confing.toml fiel)
- to add new post: go to content/post, create the .rmd blog post and and use blogdown::build_site()

 ***** CAUTION: the config.toml is included in git ignore so in order render the updated site in netlify, I need to remove the config file from the the ignore ****
