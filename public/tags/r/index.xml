      <description>My father in law is a cyclist and he usually cycle from his home located in Bry-sur-marne in Paris to the surrounding towns and localities. So I wanted to help him by a simple visualization of the cycling time from his home to different localities in a radius of 100km. I used Shiny which is an open source R package that make it easy to build interactive web applications using R.</description>
