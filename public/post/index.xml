      <description>Global sea level is monitored through a network of tide gages distributed along different coastlines which provide relative sea level measurements and satellite observations that provide also valuable data of global sea level.Satellite measurements started in 1993 and different satellite have been monitoring the sea surface height (ssh). Among the products of these satellite measurements, there is the multimission altimeter satellite gridded ssh data and derived variables computed with respect to a twenty-year mean.</description>

      <description>My father in law is a cyclist and he usually cycle from his home located in Bry-sur-marne in Paris to the surrounding towns and localities. So I wanted to help him by a simple visualization of the cycling time from his home to different localities in a radius of 100km. I used Shiny which is an open source R package that make it easy to build interactive web applications using R.</description>
