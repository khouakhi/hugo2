# Hello! ðŸ™‚

My name is Abdou khouakhi, and my current research interests lie in climate and weather data analysis, extreme climate and weather events, flood risk, sea level, data visualisation, and geographic data science.

I graduated with a PhD in coastal environments, vulnerability to sea level rise and storm surges from the Faculty of Sciences, Rabat (Morocco). I then moved to the United States for a Postdoc at IIHR-Hydroscience & Engineering, University of Iowa. There, I worked on a variety of projects related to climate and environmental data analysis (manipulation of large datasets using R and Python). Currently, I am a research associate at Loughborough University (UK), working on a project on developing models/systems to monitor flooding in real time using remote water sensing over cellular phone systems.

I have been involved in various Mediterranean projects related to coastal environments (PEGASO Project, PAC Rif central, MedRasâ€¦), in which I was responsible for spatial data management and helped build the SDI for the Moroccan Mediterranean Case study. In Morocco, I provided tuition in coastal GIS for the Masters students of the University Mohammed V Agdal, Rabat; and in particular, taught GIS and applied remote sensing (e.g. to quantify coastal erosion).

My background is also interdisciplinary, since, in addition to Academia, I have also worked in consultancy and as an Administrator in the National Mutual Aid Government department in Morocco, where I was responsible for developing cooperation with associations and NGOs. I subsequently worked in the division of human resources management.

Last, I have also worked as a volunteer and founded several associations in the field of research, development, and environment: namely (i) the Association of Young Researchers of the Faculty of Sciences- Rabat; (ii) the Moroccan Association of Geomaticians; and (iii) the Isly Association of Environment and Development. On a personal level, I am a fan of Salsa, Bachata, Surfing, Futsal and Microbreweries. I also enjoy cooking; especially Moroccan dishes ðŸ™‚
