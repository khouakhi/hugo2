# Hello! ðŸ™‚

My name is Abdou khouakhi, I am a Lecturer in Geospatial data science in the School of Water, Energy and Environment, Centre for the environment and Agricultural informatics.My research interests include extreme climate/weather events, flood risk, coastal hazards and geocomputation, remote sensing and applied machine learning.

A bit about me...

I did a PhD in coastal hazards and then moved to the USA to work as a Postdoctoral fellow at the IIHR-Hydroscience & Engineering, University of Iowa. I worked on various projects related to hydroclimatology/ hydrometeorology with a focus on extreme climate/weather events. In 2017, I joined Loughborough University's School of Architecture, Building and Civil Engineering as a Research Associate in an EPSRC funded project developing a real time monitoring and early warning system for urban floods in Mexico, using a bespoke network of wireless water sensors combined with machine learning.

On a personal level, I am a fan of Salsa, Bachata, Surfing, Futsal and Microbreweries. I also enjoy cooking; especially Moroccan dishes ðŸ™‚
